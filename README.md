Hello-World
===========

This is an example README to get familiar with GitHub

My name is <b>Vadim</b> and I'm a student of international law.<br/>
However, I am interested in web-development and decided to get a close look at git.<br/>

I'm 20 but I sometimes I think that I'm just 18 for some reason.<br/>
My website is under development, but you can try to visit it now, too. It's <a href="http://futurecss.com">FutureCSS</a>

Wish me good luck!

BR,<br/>
Vadim
